this file .....\twitter_analysis_db\help\readme_rsh.txt

This directory contains the help files for each select, possibly some are missing and
there may be a few that are for no currently existing report at all.
Select titles may be out of date.  I will try to keep up.... 

because titles keep changing, now just using a numbering system. this decouples
titles from content at least to some extent

Some notes:
 
some_querries.txt      ->  misc sql queries that mostly work and might be useful for reference
