This directory contains the help files for each select, possibly some are missing and
there may be a few that are for no currently existing report at all.
Select titles may be out of date.  I will try to keep up.... 

Some notes:


tweet_select_1.txt     ->  info for the Basic Tweet Select 
concord_select_1.txt   ->  info for the Basic Concordance Select 
select_03.txt          ->  info for Three Way Join; Full Tweet Text


some_querries.txt      ->  misc sql queries that mostly work and might be useful for reference
