Word Rank Average - working but still in development - info incomplete/inaccurate/subject to change -> (select_06.txt)

General:
    This select does a running average of the word rank of a concordance ( the concordance subject to other select criteria ).
    This give a measure of how common/uncommon the words in the concordance are.
    It is a running average, but really all that matters is the value for the final entry in the select.
    In the future we may have an option of suppressing the individual row output.
    
    The average is weighted ( by how many times the word is used ), and words that do not match anything
    in the words table are simply dropped from the average ( another option might be to assign a word rank of
    0 to such unmatched words.
    
    For inquiring minds the word rank is not implemented directly in the sql but in a pseudo column in Python.
    
For other info, experiment with it, perhaps running only about it to 

SQL:
    The concord table is joined to the tweets table, and to the words table.  <Use About It> for moLre 
    SQL info.  Post processed to add word_rank running average.
