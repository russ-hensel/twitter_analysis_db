Experimental 04  -> (select_04.txt)

    documentation will follow as select is developed
    for now experimental and all notes that follow here
    are scratch, and who know how accurate.
    
    Run about it to see sql ... probably not useful, may become a real select or not 
    
    ---------------- Probably ------------------------
General:
    A 3 way join of all tables, potentially can report on any column.  No grouping.
    Includes the full tweet text.
    Join to words table exposes info on how common/uncommon words are.
    
    may drop output of much of the tweet data to allow interestind grouping
    may also look into psedo columns of various types.
