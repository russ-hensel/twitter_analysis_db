  <TD>Hope that all House Republicans will vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s War Powers Resolution. Also remember her “speed &amp; rush” in getting the Impeachment Hoax voted on &amp; done. Well she never sent the Articles to the Senate. Just another Democrat fraud. Presidential Harassment!</TD>

  <TD>Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud and for whatever reason  doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends</TD>

  <TD>Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens military and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting which is “RIPE for FRAUD” and shouldn’t be allowed!</TD>
